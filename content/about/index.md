# Introduction 
```
root@curiousgeorge:~ $ cat info.txt
```
My name is Sam, I'm from Australia and I am a big enthusiast in IT, and a nerd. I self-taught myself using Youtube videos, podcasts and lots, lots of Google searches. I especially enjoy the HAK5 podcasts, but there are numerous other ones I listen to aswell. I have no certifications in anything, no degrees, but I am still a reasonably well-knowledgable person in IT. My future  is looking to be something as either an ethical hacker or pen-tester, but we'll have to wait and see.
# The Reason for This Blog

Why not share my journey with others? Inspire others to follow the same route I took, and have a intellectually educational adventure with it? I want to share with everyone what I have learnt and I want to share the experience with you and anyone else who may come across my blog. All the knowledge I have taken from around the Internet and that has been processed through my brain can be shared within this blog and towards anyone who is interested in the same careers and jobs as me.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to stop by this blog. I hope that you find it helpful with whatever brought you here, and that you can also share your experience with others as well.

Thanks.
